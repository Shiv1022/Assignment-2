            Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th
            president of the United States, serving from 1861 until his
            assassination in 1865. He led the United States through the American
            Civil War, defending the nation as a constitutional union, defeating
            the Confederacy, playing a major role in the abolition of slavery,
            expanding the power of the federal government, and modernizing the
            U.S. economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was
            raised on the frontier, mainly in Indiana. He was self-educated and
            became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and
            U.S. representative from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his
            successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois. In 1854, angered
            by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery,
            he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new
            Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate
            campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for
            president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery
            elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery,
            and Southern states began seceding from the nation. They formed the
            Confederate States of America, which began seizing federal military
            bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed
            the presidency, Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort
            in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized
            forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.

            in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized
            forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union. Lincoln, a
            moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions
            with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican
            parties. His allies, the War Democrats and the Radical Republicans,
            demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed
            the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully
            distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American
            people. Anti-war Democrats (called "Copperheads") despised Lincoln,
            and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to
            plot his assassination. His Gettysburg Address became one of the
            most famous speeches in American history. Lincoln closely supervised
            the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection
            of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the South's trade.
            He suspended habeas corpus in Maryland and elsewhere, and he averted
            war with Britain by defusing the Trent Affair. In 1863, he issued
            the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the
            states "in rebellion" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy
            to "recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons" and to
            receive them "into the armed service of the United States." Lincoln
            pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the
            Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished
            slavery, except as punishment for a crime. Lincoln managed his own
            successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn
            nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days
            after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, he was attending a
            play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Mary,
            when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes
            Booth.
